        <p>Sigiriya Rock or the Lion Rock is an ancient fort located in the Matale District in central Sri Lanka. It is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. It is in the Matale District of Central Sri Lanka and lies between the towns of Dambulla and Habarane at
            the height of 370 metres. It consists of a citadel and has ruins of palaces, the Lion Gate, gardens, moats, the Mirror Wall, and many beautiful frescoes (paintings made in wet plaster on walls). The place got its name from the Lion claws,
            carved at the entrance of the Lion Gate. You can reach the Sigiriya Fortress either by bus or by train, from the main towns of Dambulla or Habarane. The Sigiriya Rock Fortress is derived from two words - 'Simha' meaning Lion, and 'Giri' meaning
            Mountain. The site consists of the beautifully planned fortress, ruined halls, a citadel, the Mirror Wall, and many ancient paintings on the walls called 'Frescoes'. Beautiful gardens and moats surround this fortress. King Kashyapa built it
            after he shifted his capital to Sigiriya. The entire climb takes about an hour and has the most ethereal looking views of the land below. The climb is quite steep in some areas and is not recommended for the elderly. The site opens at 7:00
            AM from Monday to Saturday and is easily accessible from nearby towns. The price is worth it, and you are sure to witness many breathtaking views.</p>
