    <p>The story of the Galle Dutch Fort; a UNESCO World Heritage Site reverberates through every traveller’s photos and captions. Initially built by the Portuguese in the 16th century during their conquests, the fort was later fortified and conquered by
        the Dutch in the 17th century, until it later fell to the might of the British. The old town of Galle was once used as a trading port for spices and other goods for over 200 years. However, today, the fort has been transformed into a place of
        history, romance and beauty where travellers are warmly welcomed to dive head first into the exotic stories and be a part of this heritage site. Fifty Lighthouse Street is set within the fort and offers the perfect base for you to explore the
        charms of Galle. Preserved in its original glory, stroll along the ramparts and admire the imposing structures like the Galle Lighthouse, Galle Clocktower and the Groote Kerk. A Galle Fort Walking Tour with us, will reveal secrets that only a
        local from within the fort will know. Our walking tour takes you through the backroads of this iconic fort, visiting charming structures, museums, old buildings and more as you hear endless stories, legends and some secrets of the Galle Dutch
        Fort.

    <p>Adam’s Peak, mountain in southwestern Sri Lanka. It is 7,559 feet (2,304 metres) high and located 11 miles (18 km) northeast of Ratnapura, the capital of Sabaragamuwa province. It is well known for the Sri Pada (Sinhala for “Sacred Footprint”), a
        hollow that is 67 inches (170 cm) long and 18 inches (46 cm) wide and resembles the print of a human foot. The Sri Pada is venerated by Buddhists, Hindus, Christians, and Muslims. Many pilgrims of all faiths visit the peak every year. Adam’s Peak
        is not the tallest mountain in Sri Lanka (that honour belongs to Pidurutalagala), but it stands above the surrounding range, and its conical shape gives it the appearance of a pyramid. The region surrounding Adam’s Peak is a tropical rainforest
        and includes the Peak Wilderness Sanctuary, created as a conservation zone in 1940. It is home to an elephant population isolated from the lowlands by the tea estates surrounding the sanctuary. Three major rivers of Sri Lanka—the Kelani, the Walawe,
        and the Kalu—originate at Adam’s Peak. The peak is composed of gneiss rock and is known for being rich in garnets, rubies, and sapphires.</p>
