    <p>The story of the Galle Dutch Fort; a UNESCO World Heritage Site reverberates through every traveller’s photos and captions. Initially built by the Portuguese in the 16th century during their conquests, the fort was later fortified and conquered by
        the Dutch in the 17th century, until it later fell to the might of the British. The old town of Galle was once used as a trading port for spices and other goods for over 200 years. However, today, the fort has been transformed into a place of
        history, romance and beauty where travellers are warmly welcomed to dive head first into the exotic stories and be a part of this heritage site. Fifty Lighthouse Street is set within the fort and offers the perfect base for you to explore the
        charms of Galle. Preserved in its original glory, stroll along the ramparts and admire the imposing structures like the Galle Lighthouse, Galle Clocktower and the Groote Kerk. A Galle Fort Walking Tour with us, will reveal secrets that only a
        local from within the fort will know. Our walking tour takes you through the backroads of this iconic fort, visiting charming structures, museums, old buildings and more as you hear endless stories, legends and some secrets of the Galle Dutch
        Fort.

    <p>Adam’s Peak, mountain in southwestern Sri Lanka. It is 7,559 feet (2,304 metres) high and located 11 miles (18 km) northeast of Ratnapura, the capital of Sabaragamuwa province. It is well known for the Sri Pada (Sinhala for “Sacred Footprint”), a
        hollow that is 67 inches (170 cm) long and 18 inches (46 cm) wide and resembles the print of a human foot. The Sri Pada is venerated by Buddhists, Hindus, Christians, and Muslims. Many pilgrims of all faiths visit the peak every year. Adam’s Peak
        is not the tallest mountain in Sri Lanka (that honour belongs to Pidurutalagala), but it stands above the surrounding range, and its conical shape gives it the appearance of a pyramid. The region surrounding Adam’s Peak is a tropical rainforest
        and includes the Peak Wilderness Sanctuary, created as a conservation zone in 1940. It is home to an elephant population isolated from the lowlands by the tea estates surrounding the sanctuary. Three major rivers of Sri Lanka—the Kelani, the Walawe,
        and the Kalu—originate at Adam’s Peak. The peak is composed of gneiss rock and is known for being rich in garnets, rubies, and sapphires.</p>

    <p>The Ruwanwelisaya Dagoba was built in 140 BC by King Dutugemunu, who later became King of all Sri Lanka after defeating the Chola King, Ellalan. Dutugamunu was king of the Anuradhapura Kingdom, and reigned from 161 to 137 BC, expanding the city of
        Anuradhapura to project the power of Sinhalese culture across Sri Lanka. The stupa was constructed in a hemispherical shape, its purpose to hold the relics of the Gothama Buddha. However, King Dutugemunu died before its completion, his brother
        Saddhatissa ascending the throne. The stupa was a ruin by the 19th century, having been overgrown with new forestry. Yet after meticulous fundraising efforts by a Sinhalese bhikkhu, male Buddhist monks, it was renovated in the early 20th century.
        The Ruwanveli Seya Restoration Society, including, philanthropist Hendrick Appuhamy, donated Rs 20 million for the restoration works. Foundations were laid in 1902 and the stupa was crowned in June 1940. The design of the stupa was designed to
        reflect the teachings of Buddha: the dome representing the vastness of doctrine, the four facets signifying the Four Noble Truths, concentric rings highlighting the Noble Eightfold Middle Path, and a large crystal on top represents the goal of
        Buddhist enlightenment.</p>

    <p>Approximately 12.5 km (7.8 mi) east of Anuradhapura, close to the Anuradhapura - Trincomalee Road is situated the "Missaka Pabbata" which is 1,000 feet (300 m) in height and is one of the peaks of a mountainous range. According to Dipavamsa and Mahavamsa,
        Thera Mahinda came to Sri Lanka from India on the full moon day of the month of Poson (June) and met King Devanampiyatissa and preached the Buddhist doctrine. The traditional spot where this meeting took place is revered by the Buddhists of Sri
        Lanka. Therefore, in the month of Poson, Buddhists make their pilgrimage to Anuradhapura and Mihintale. Mahinda was the son of Emperor Ashoka of India. King Ashoka embraced Buddhism after he was inspired by a monk named “Nigrodha.” The King was
        in great misery after witnessing the devastation caused by expansionist wars. Meeting this peaceful young monk was a turning point in his life, thereafter, he renounced war. He was determined to spread the message of peace. As a result, both his
        son and daughter were ordained as Buddhist monastics, and became enlightened Arahats. In his quest to spread the message of peace instead of war, Ashoka sent his son Mahinda, to the island of Lanka, which was also known as “Sinhalé”. This island
        was ruled by his friend King Devanampiyatissa. Thus, “Mahinda” was the Indian name, which in Sinhalé, became “Mihindu.” In Sinhala Mihin-Thalé literally means the “plateau of Mihindu”. This plateau is on top of a hill from where Arahat Mihindu
        was supposed to have called King Devanampiyatissa, by the King's name to stop him shooting a deer. Hence, “Mihin Thalé” is a specifically Sinhala term. From ancient times, large steps were constructed to climb Mihintale. It is stated that King
        Devanampiyatissa constructed a vihara and 68 caves for the bhikkhus to reside in. At Mihintale there gradually grew a number of Buddhist monasteries or viharas with all the dependent buildings characteristic of the monasteries of that period.</p>

    <p>Jaya Sri Maha Bodhi is a sacred bo tree in the Mahamewna Garden in historical city of Anuradhapura, Sri Lanka. This is believed to be a tree grown from a cutting of the southern branch from the historical sacred bo tree, Sri Maha Bodhi, at Buddha
        Gaya in India, under which Siddhartha Gautama (Buddha) attained Enlightenment. The Buddhist nun Sangamitta Maha Theri, a daughter of Indian Emperor Ashoka, in 288 BC brought the tree cutting to Sri Lanka during the reign of Sinhalese King Devanampiya
        Tissa. It is the oldest living human-planted tree in the world with a known planting date and is more than 2300 years old now. The Mahavamsa, or the great chronicle of the Sinhalese, provides an elaborate account of the establishment of the Jaya
        Siri Maha Bodhi on the Island and the subsequent development of the site as a major Buddhist pilgrimage site. Today, the Jaya Siri Maha Bodhi is situated on a high terrace, about 6.5 meters above the ground, and surrounded by 4 other lower-level
        terraces with Bo trees called “Parivara Bodhi” planted for its protection. The site is currently administered by the Chief High Priest of Atamasthana and the Atamasthana Palakasabha, the administrative body of the Atamasthana, and receives millions
        of pilgrims each year. The site is open to visitors and continuously hosts numerous acts of worship throughout the year. However, access to the uppermost terrace where the bo tree is located is restricted due to the old age of the tree and various
        acts of vandalism it has endured throughout history, including a terrorist attack by LTTE in 1985, where around 146 pilgrims were massacred.</p>

    <p>Commissioned under the British in the year 1921, the Nine Arch Bridge stands proudly, a testament to the engineering and architectural brilliance of the early 20th century. Ideally placed between the Ella and Demodara railway station, those choosing
        to walk along the bridge will be presented with scenes of rolling hills and dense jungle to delight in. The Nine Arch Bridge, also known as the ‘Bridge in the Sky’ was constructed by connecting two bog mountains when constructing the Badulla –
        Colombo railway. This bridge is 300 feet in length, 25 feet in width and 80-100 feet in height. It is one of the best examples of colonial-era railway construction in the country. The Bridge can be reached by travelling 2km on Gotuwala road starting
        from Halpe Textile centre in Badulla Bandarawela road. The surrounding area has seen a steady increase in tourism due to the bridge’s architectural ingenuity and the profuse greenery in the nearby hillsides. Arguably the best time to venture out
        would be during when the locomotives come barrelling along and thus it is advisable to check on the train schedule in advance. However, be sure to carry your trusty cam with you so that you might capture every moment that unravels before you.</p>

    <p>Touring the idyllic town of Ella would be incomplete if one misses out on experiencing the wonder of Ravana Falls. Renowned for being one of Sri Lanka’s widest waterfalls, this 82 ft. the cascading body of water is nestled within the Ravana Ella Wildlife
        Sanctuary and a further six km from the Ella Railway Station. While providing outstanding opportunities for a leisurely swim, adventure seekers will also find that climbing some of the rocks located nearby affords awe-inspiring vistas of both
        the falls as well as some of Ella’s treasured surroundings. Ravana falls is named after the demon King Ravana who according to traditional folklore is believed to have ruled Sri Lanka. It is a popular sightseeing attraction in Sri Lanka and currently
        ranks as one of the widest waterfalls in the country. It is best visited during the local wet season when the water is said to resemble an Areca flower with withering petals. This is situated in the 12-13thmilepost of Ella Wellawaya road. Ravana
        Falls can also be reached by travelling 10km towards Wellawaya from Kubalwela junction in Badulla Bandarawela road and could be a quick stop along the way as it can be viewed from the main road.</p>
