    <p>The story of the Galle Dutch Fort; a UNESCO World Heritage Site reverberates through every traveller’s photos and captions. Initially built by the Portuguese in the 16th century during their conquests, the fort was later fortified and conquered by
        the Dutch in the 17th century, until it later fell to the might of the British. The old town of Galle was once used as a trading port for spices and other goods for over 200 years. However, today, the fort has been transformed into a place of
        history, romance and beauty where travellers are warmly welcomed to dive head first into the exotic stories and be a part of this heritage site. Fifty Lighthouse Street is set within the fort and offers the perfect base for you to explore the
        charms of Galle. Preserved in its original glory, stroll along the ramparts and admire the imposing structures like the Galle Lighthouse, Galle Clocktower and the Groote Kerk. A Galle Fort Walking Tour with us, will reveal secrets that only a
        local from within the fort will know. Our walking tour takes you through the backroads of this iconic fort, visiting charming structures, museums, old buildings and more as you hear endless stories, legends and some secrets of the Galle Dutch
        Fort.

    <p>Adam’s Peak, mountain in southwestern Sri Lanka. It is 7,559 feet (2,304 metres) high and located 11 miles (18 km) northeast of Ratnapura, the capital of Sabaragamuwa province. It is well known for the Sri Pada (Sinhala for “Sacred Footprint”), a
        hollow that is 67 inches (170 cm) long and 18 inches (46 cm) wide and resembles the print of a human foot. The Sri Pada is venerated by Buddhists, Hindus, Christians, and Muslims. Many pilgrims of all faiths visit the peak every year. Adam’s Peak
        is not the tallest mountain in Sri Lanka (that honour belongs to Pidurutalagala), but it stands above the surrounding range, and its conical shape gives it the appearance of a pyramid. The region surrounding Adam’s Peak is a tropical rainforest
        and includes the Peak Wilderness Sanctuary, created as a conservation zone in 1940. It is home to an elephant population isolated from the lowlands by the tea estates surrounding the sanctuary. Three major rivers of Sri Lanka—the Kelani, the Walawe,
        and the Kalu—originate at Adam’s Peak. The peak is composed of gneiss rock and is known for being rich in garnets, rubies, and sapphires.</p>

    <p>The Ruwanwelisaya Dagoba was built in 140 BC by King Dutugemunu, who later became King of all Sri Lanka after defeating the Chola King, Ellalan. Dutugamunu was king of the Anuradhapura Kingdom, and reigned from 161 to 137 BC, expanding the city of
        Anuradhapura to project the power of Sinhalese culture across Sri Lanka. The stupa was constructed in a hemispherical shape, its purpose to hold the relics of the Gothama Buddha. However, King Dutugemunu died before its completion, his brother
        Saddhatissa ascending the throne. The stupa was a ruin by the 19th century, having been overgrown with new forestry. Yet after meticulous fundraising efforts by a Sinhalese bhikkhu, male Buddhist monks, it was renovated in the early 20th century.
        The Ruwanveli Seya Restoration Society, including, philanthropist Hendrick Appuhamy, donated Rs 20 million for the restoration works. Foundations were laid in 1902 and the stupa was crowned in June 1940. The design of the stupa was designed to
        reflect the teachings of Buddha: the dome representing the vastness of doctrine, the four facets signifying the Four Noble Truths, concentric rings highlighting the Noble Eightfold Middle Path, and a large crystal on top represents the goal of
        Buddhist enlightenment.</p>

    <p>Approximately 12.5 km (7.8 mi) east of Anuradhapura, close to the Anuradhapura - Trincomalee Road is situated the "Missaka Pabbata" which is 1,000 feet (300 m) in height and is one of the peaks of a mountainous range. According to Dipavamsa and Mahavamsa,
        Thera Mahinda came to Sri Lanka from India on the full moon day of the month of Poson (June) and met King Devanampiyatissa and preached the Buddhist doctrine. The traditional spot where this meeting took place is revered by the Buddhists of Sri
        Lanka. Therefore, in the month of Poson, Buddhists make their pilgrimage to Anuradhapura and Mihintale. Mahinda was the son of Emperor Ashoka of India. King Ashoka embraced Buddhism after he was inspired by a monk named “Nigrodha.” The King was
        in great misery after witnessing the devastation caused by expansionist wars. Meeting this peaceful young monk was a turning point in his life, thereafter, he renounced war. He was determined to spread the message of peace. As a result, both his
        son and daughter were ordained as Buddhist monastics, and became enlightened Arahats. In his quest to spread the message of peace instead of war, Ashoka sent his son Mahinda, to the island of Lanka, which was also known as “Sinhalé”. This island
        was ruled by his friend King Devanampiyatissa. Thus, “Mahinda” was the Indian name, which in Sinhalé, became “Mihindu.” In Sinhala Mihin-Thalé literally means the “plateau of Mihindu”. This plateau is on top of a hill from where Arahat Mihindu
        was supposed to have called King Devanampiyatissa, by the King's name to stop him shooting a deer. Hence, “Mihin Thalé” is a specifically Sinhala term. From ancient times, large steps were constructed to climb Mihintale. It is stated that King
        Devanampiyatissa constructed a vihara and 68 caves for the bhikkhus to reside in. At Mihintale there gradually grew a number of Buddhist monasteries or viharas with all the dependent buildings characteristic of the monasteries of that period.</p>

    <p>Jaya Sri Maha Bodhi is a sacred bo tree in the Mahamewna Garden in historical city of Anuradhapura, Sri Lanka. This is believed to be a tree grown from a cutting of the southern branch from the historical sacred bo tree, Sri Maha Bodhi, at Buddha
        Gaya in India, under which Siddhartha Gautama (Buddha) attained Enlightenment. The Buddhist nun Sangamitta Maha Theri, a daughter of Indian Emperor Ashoka, in 288 BC brought the tree cutting to Sri Lanka during the reign of Sinhalese King Devanampiya
        Tissa. It is the oldest living human-planted tree in the world with a known planting date and is more than 2300 years old now. The Mahavamsa, or the great chronicle of the Sinhalese, provides an elaborate account of the establishment of the Jaya
        Siri Maha Bodhi on the Island and the subsequent development of the site as a major Buddhist pilgrimage site. Today, the Jaya Siri Maha Bodhi is situated on a high terrace, about 6.5 meters above the ground, and surrounded by 4 other lower-level
        terraces with Bo trees called “Parivara Bodhi” planted for its protection. The site is currently administered by the Chief High Priest of Atamasthana and the Atamasthana Palakasabha, the administrative body of the Atamasthana, and receives millions
        of pilgrims each year. The site is open to visitors and continuously hosts numerous acts of worship throughout the year. However, access to the uppermost terrace where the bo tree is located is restricted due to the old age of the tree and various
        acts of vandalism it has endured throughout history, including a terrorist attack by LTTE in 1985, where around 146 pilgrims were massacred.</p>

    <p>Commissioned under the British in the year 1921, the Nine Arch Bridge stands proudly, a testament to the engineering and architectural brilliance of the early 20th century. Ideally placed between the Ella and Demodara railway station, those choosing
        to walk along the bridge will be presented with scenes of rolling hills and dense jungle to delight in. The Nine Arch Bridge, also known as the ‘Bridge in the Sky’ was constructed by connecting two bog mountains when constructing the Badulla –
        Colombo railway. This bridge is 300 feet in length, 25 feet in width and 80-100 feet in height. It is one of the best examples of colonial-era railway construction in the country. The Bridge can be reached by travelling 2km on Gotuwala road starting
        from Halpe Textile centre in Badulla Bandarawela road. The surrounding area has seen a steady increase in tourism due to the bridge’s architectural ingenuity and the profuse greenery in the nearby hillsides. Arguably the best time to venture out
        would be during when the locomotives come barrelling along and thus it is advisable to check on the train schedule in advance. However, be sure to carry your trusty cam with you so that you might capture every moment that unravels before you.</p>

    <p>Touring the idyllic town of Ella would be incomplete if one misses out on experiencing the wonder of Ravana Falls. Renowned for being one of Sri Lanka’s widest waterfalls, this 82 ft. the cascading body of water is nestled within the Ravana Ella Wildlife
        Sanctuary and a further six km from the Ella Railway Station. While providing outstanding opportunities for a leisurely swim, adventure seekers will also find that climbing some of the rocks located nearby affords awe-inspiring vistas of both
        the falls as well as some of Ella’s treasured surroundings. Ravana falls is named after the demon King Ravana who according to traditional folklore is believed to have ruled Sri Lanka. It is a popular sightseeing attraction in Sri Lanka and currently
        ranks as one of the widest waterfalls in the country. It is best visited during the local wet season when the water is said to resemble an Areca flower with withering petals. This is situated in the 12-13thmilepost of Ella Wellawaya road. Ravana
        Falls can also be reached by travelling 10km towards Wellawaya from Kubalwela junction in Badulla Bandarawela road and could be a quick stop along the way as it can be viewed from the main road.</p>

    <p>The Temple of the Sacred Tooth Relic is a world-renowned place of worship, where the left tooth of Gautama Buddha is enshrined. The temple which is venerated by thousands of local & foreign devotees and tourists daily was named as a world heritage
        by UNESCO in 1988. The temple which carries a lot of value to Buddhists all over the world also has immense cultural value. The architecture is of unique Kandyan architectural style with a combination of the unique style used to build “Dalada
        Mandira” the shrines which housed the Sacred Tooth Relic previously in other kingdoms. The temple of the Sacred Tooth Relic is built in the city of Kandy near the ancient Royal Palace which is situated to the North of the temple and the forest
        reserve called “Udawaththa Kelaya” to the East. The famous Kandy Lake also known as “Kiri Muhuda” to the South and “Natha & Paththini Devala” on the West. The temple is adorned with intricate carvings using gold, silver, bronze and ivory. The
        Sacred city of Kandy is the final location of the Sacred Tooth Relic of Gautama Buddha. The Sacred relic was brought to Sri Lanka by Princess Hemamala & Prince Dantha from the city of Kalinga in ancient India, during the reign of King Keerthi
        Sri Meghavarna (Kithsirimevan 301 -328). It became a symbol of Sri Lankan kings and was preciously guarded in a special shrine built within the precincts of the royal palace, wherever the capital was located. The ruins of such edifices remain
        in ancient capitals of Anuradapura, Pollonnaruwa, Dambadeniya, Yapahuwa, Kurunegala, Kotte and Gampola. While in Kandy the last Kingdom the Temple of the Sacred Tooth Relic continues to be the greatest shrine to receive the utmost veneration of
        the Buddhist world. The first “Dalada Madura” in Kandy, which housed the Sacred Tooth Relic was built by King Wimaladharmasuriya the first during his reign from year 1592 – 1604. History reveals that this was destroyed by the Portuguese during
        their invasions. The second temple was built in the same location by King Rajasinghe the Second during his reign from 1635 – 1687, which was burnt by the Dutch. The Dalada history says in year 1687 King Wimaladharmasuriya the Second built a 3
        storeyed Dalada Madura and performed Dalada rituals with great devotion but with time the building was decayed and destroyed. Later his son King Sri Veera Parakrama Narendrasinghe who reigned from 1707 – 1739 built the 2 storeyed Dalada Madura
        which one can see today. The South Indian Kings who ruled the country from Senkadagala renovated and protected the shrine which was built by King Narendrasinghe. The temple was finely renovated and beautified by King Keerthi Sri Rajasinghe to
        its present appearance. Paththirippuwa or the Octagonal Pavilion was constructed by King Sri Wickrama Rajasinghe who reigned from year 1798 – 1815. Protecting of the Sacred Tooth Relic and conducting religious rituals without a break is being
        carried out to the present day under the strict surveillance of the three chief custodians of the Tooth Relic, the most Venerable Mahanayake theros of Malwatta and Asgiriya chapters and the lay custodian, the Diyawadana Nilame.

    <p>The Kandy Lake lies serenely beside the sacred Temple of the Sacred Tooth Relic. Also called the “Kiri Muhuda” or the Sea of Milk, it is an artificial lake built by the last king of Sri Lanka, Sri Vikrama Rajasinha in 1807. According to legend the
        small island at its centre was used as a bathing point for the royals and was accessed through a secret tunnel. The tree-lined path around the lake is ideal for a quiet stroll or jog, while if you head to the Kandy View Point above, you can enjoy
        spectacular panoramic views of the city.</p>

    <p>The Sacred Tooth Relic, which is housed at the Temple of the Sacred Tooth Relic in the city of Kandy, is being considered and worshipped as the living Lord Buddha. For this very reason, there are daily, weekly and annual poojas and rituals. Dalada
        Perahera famously known as the Kandy Esala Perahera held in the month of Esala (July) annually is among them. It is considered as the epitome of country’s Buddhist celebrations and is blessed with divinity. According to Maha Parinibbana sutta
        of Deegha Chapter, among few other sacred relics, the four sacred tooth relics remained intact following Mahaparinirvana. Lord Buddha’s left canine tooth out of the four Tooth Relics which was blessed with Sri Saddhamma for 45 years was brought
        to Sri Lanka due to the continuous conflicts during the reign of King Mutaseewa in the kingdom of Kaalinga. Princess Hemamala and Prince Dantha brought the Tooth Relic to Sri Lanka during the reign of King Kithsirimewan, seeking protection for
        the Sacred Tooth Relic. This incident took place in 310 A.D. Following the arrival of the Sacred Tooth Relic, it was first housed in the Isurumuniya Temple and was honoured and worshipped with Dalada Perahera by King Kithsirimewan. It was so splendid
        that it left the King Kithsirimewan and the country men with amazement and awe. They made it an annual event performed in Anuradhapura kingdom with the anticipation of timely rain and good harvest. The background for the current street parading
        Dalada Perahera was set on those circumstances. No matter how the king was crowned, if he did not obtain the guardianship of the Sacred Tooth Relic, which has the miraculous power of giving timely rain and good harvest, in the eyes of the country
        men he was not regarded as the true leader with sovereignty. During the kingdoms of Anuradhapura, Polonnaruwa, Dambadeniya, Yapahuwa, Kurunegala, Gampola, Kotte, Seethawaka and Kandy annual Dalada Perahera was performed as a showcase of the guardianship
        of the Sacred Tooth Relic along with all rituals and Poojas. Even though King Wimaladharmasooriya I was crowned, he was not considered as the true king among the country men since he did not have the guardianship of the Sacred Tooth Relic. Hence,
        plenteous attempts were done by him to bring the sacred tooth relic to the kingdom of Senkadagala (now Kandy). Later on, under the protection of Dewanagala Rathnalankara Thero, the Sacred Tooth Relic was secretly brought from Sabaragamuwa Delagamuwa
        Maha Viharaya to Kandy via Uva province and was first placed in the Gedige Viharaya in Asgiriya, Kandy. According to the tales of history, a grandeur temple was built for the Sacred Tooth Relic in the premises of the Royal palace. As a result,
        the Temple of Tooth Relic in Kandy was established. Sri Dalada Perahera, which continued to pay homage to the Sacred Tooth Relic with numerous rituals and performances was held in the month of Esala (July) until the country was entirely colonized
        by the British in 1815 A.D. Afterwards, it was permitted by the British colonizers, who made the country a kingless state, to perform Sri Dalada Perahera and the traditions relevant to the Sacred Tooth Relic continuously, with the custody of a
        Diyawadana Nilame (Chief Custodian). The tradition of Dalada Perahera, which was based on Buddhist respect and kindness, combined with rituals of Devala, prioritizing the ultimate humanity. The Kandy Esala Perahera Casket which is considered as
        living Lord Buddha which parades the streets is worshipped by the divinity, humanity and elephants. This is considered to be the oldest cultural event in the world and continues with its colourful,glamorous splendour making it an out of this world
        experience.</p>
